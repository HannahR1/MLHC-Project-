In this work, we apply survival modeling methods on UK Biobank data (UKBB) to evaluate
and optimize the McCance Brain Care Score (M-BCS), a new tool recently developed
by the McCance Center for Brain Health (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston) to
predict risk of stroke and cognitive decline. We use survival models to gain insight about
longitudinal risk for developing dementia and stroke. Applying a non-paramterized Kaplan
Meier estimator on the stratified data elucidates how single features could contribute to
risk of developing either disease over time. Additionally, applying a semi-parameterized
Cox Proportional Hazards model (CoxPH) allow for personalized patient information to be
captured and used to predict time to developing disease. Our results validate the utility of
the M-BCS in predicting risk of stroke/dementia and identifies additional predictive features
that could potentially be included in a newly optimized score
